# Coffee Machine

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine, and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project is a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, coffee beans, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
